I bet you know about the classic Mario game and probably have played it. You are on a quest, moving from levels to levels in search of a princess that has been kidnapped. You crush all the spooky dogs and flying turtles with the superpowers such as transforming into giant, shooting out bullets.
But hey! On top of the energy of a naive Mario, you seamlessly have played the never-ending game of Pacman — yes the world where these elusive ghosts chase you (the ultimate player) for the reason that seems mysterious.
Lust
It’s funny how you move around the strange two-dimensional world, just for the sake of eating, eating and eating. Yes, the only reason you move is with this mysterious force to devour everything in the path. You can never get enough of it. In your life, there is always something more you want. That need never gets quenched. The game is a reflection of lust.
Eternal Dissatisfaction
Your lust never dies. You move from level to level. Your existence has no meaning. Your life is an endless rush into oblivion. You don’t realize what you have been missing the whole time. You don’t even dare to stop. Because if you do, the ghosts in your mind devour you completely. There’s always this dissatisfaction in your life that interrupts the harmony between your soul and the world outside.
Desire
Desire is something that bounds life itself to the existence. Your desire for more; more never ends. Money, love, life, and all the chaos. That’s all you think of. You can’t put aside your desires and be yourself. You can’t really focus on your own “I, Me and Myself” against the world that wants more and more.
Levels upon levels upon levels, your existence thrive upon these uncanny behaviors.
Achievement
While life is chasing you and you are chasing the unknowns, there comes a point in life where you feel achieved. You feel you can conquer the world. You can triumph over the ghosts in your mind. That satisfaction of achievement ultimately boosts your inner pride; hence your inner peace is restored. It’s this factor that really factors out all the negativity in your life.
But, again life happens. The achievement; you can’t really get enough of it. Hence, the ultimate cycle continues:
Lust, dissatisfaction, desire and achievement makes you who you should be. i live in the land of nowhere. 
I am doing fine in my life which is very chaos. I am trying to find myself among chaos and peace.


I am paradox and there exists a theoretical limit to human mind that any imagination is not unbound yet there is something that meets the eye.
The eye itself is an absolute organ to wisdom. Wisdom is something that is derived from mutation of knowledge with experience. Yet, there exists a paradox on how much wise a man is even if there is no bound to the lies s/he tells.
You suffer; you struggle.
Struggle is the path to the wisdom and yet there lies a paradox on how much one can tolerate. Tolerance is eternal; knowledge is bounded. Endurance is a paradox. Paradox in a sense that you never know how much a mind can endure until you have exposed everything to the mind.
You can laugh; you can cry.
It’s ok to cry. Cry you heart out. Crying is a spiritual path to let your sufferings out to the ever paradoxical world. You can laugh your ass off but you can never put your heart into the laughing unless you know what the context is.
Every animal struggles, endures, cries and laughs.
One can suffer spiritually as well as physically. If spiritually one feels the sufferings, there’ll be no peace of mind. Yet there lies a paradox in life.
Paradox in life is paradoxical.
“Paradox” itself is a paradox. You cannot define the absolute lifespan of a paradox because you never get to live physically throughout your life.
Indeed, life mocks everyone. It’s like that little piece of paper that slits your throat and you’ll never know how you died because you were blind the whole time. You may not feel the pain. But the suffering is real. Now, knowledge is that paper and you are the wisdom.
Knowlege pours life into nullness, yet it is can kill one’s spirit. Knowlege has never been an absolute wisdom. Absoluteness of a wisdom can never really exists. Existence in a sense one can never feel the real happiness until s/he has transcended to some meta reality.
Reality mocks everyone. It has been from the ancient times. Time is a fuzzy feeling. Fuzziness persists. Yet, you always tell “how much” time has gone by. Because you feel time. You never really kiss it.
Those sarcastic tone that every time gives. Time creeps yet it slips away. You never really know what it can give you.
Time is pretty paradoxical. Paradoxical in a sense that you always procrastinate. Procrastination is real, so is your mind. Theoretically, time can fall and you can too. You can never really know the feeling.
Now, there lies a paradox about mind itself. Mind is nothing but your brain and your brain is only the combinations of indidvidual cells.
Now the greatest paradox of mind is the consciousness. You feel, suffer, look, taste, struggle, endure. It’s all in your mind and you still have a feeling of unity of your mind and body.
So, who gets the wisdom? Consciousness is just a combination of chemicals and the signals that overpower your brain. There really exists a dilemma on who/what controls you and perhaps who are you in a true sense.
In the end, you are just living a life full of paradoxes and whole reality you perceive has been established on the basis of assumptions.
Life is just an assumption and you should be the one who can hypothesize, transcend, believe, execute, halt and moreover live with personal satisfaction.


Tonight! I am not sad.
Nor I am mad.
I am expressionless.
There’s nothing I have to express.
There’s no desire at expense.
Tonight! I am a commoner.
A Son — whose heart beats for his mother.
A Child — dreams all stout
A Brother — sister’s hopes echo aloud
A Neighbour — lively yet mysterious
A Citizen — responsible, inglorious
A no one — lurking in the shadow
Tonight! I am a friend
A faceless in the circle
Independent — lost in thoughts
Of love, life and arts
Some reasons to live
None clinging to another’s dream
Tonight! I am a pedestrian
Wandering around, feeling the rain
A Walker — indifferent yet significant
A Watcher —looking beyond the blurred lens
A Thinker — lost in dreams
Of silence and screams.
A Painter — filling the imagination
With life and thoughts
Still, I am no one rushing around.
Tonight — It is special.
I am on a date — with Peace and Chaos
No emotions — I am expressionless
Tonight! I am in search of myself.
A someone — a face under the mask
A traveller through time
A wanderer through life.
A stargazer — in awe of vastness
Of life and emptiness.
In the vastness of people
I seek redemption
Like an apparition.
Emotions. Thoughts. All lost.
They think I am mental
I probably am a retard
Like a circus clown faking a laugh.
I probably am a freak
Like a specimen in a bio lab.
Perhaps I am a stranger
Walking on an unknown path.
Tap. Tap. Tap. As the time walks.
I crawl. Hush!
I crawl. They sprawl.
In the mist.
Emotions. Thoughts. All lost.
I seek inner peace.

The blood rush has stalled.
May be the world is blind
Where I am just one of a kind
In an endless streaks
Of hopes and hopelessness
I am enduring time
Like a soldier on a field of mines
Looking for freedom.
Boom! The mind explodes.
Emotions. Thoughts. All lost
The battle of a man. A boy. A child.
Solitude. Isolation. Silence.
The shadow lurks — “who goes there?”
Oh yes. That’s just me.
Seeking inner peace.
In solitude, I find myself.
In isolation, my mind thrives.
This is a battle of a man to be born from a child.
Boom! There goes another mine.
Emotions. Thoughts. All lost.

Knock Knock!
“I am time.” — comes an unknown sound.
“I know no time.”, I reply.
The only time I know is the time that took my life.
For the time took my Emotions. Thoughts. My silent cry.
The time kept on knocking.
I kept on ignoring.
As they say ignorance is a bliss.
But the only bliss is a solitude.
It is a fortitude.
It is worth suffering for.
For I seek inner peace.
I seek salvation.
Not a cremation.
For I am the isolation you won’t seek.
I am the solitude you won’t find.
I am the silence you won’t hear.

It’s funny how most of the humans loathe cockroaches. Well, it’s in human nature to develop some kinds of fear against creepiness and Entomophobia persists really hard in the mind.
Despite the fact, cockroaches have always intrigued me. Not because I like to kill ’em all; but how we humans are pretty similar to cockroaches in terms of behaviours and opportunities we ought to seek.
Humans, the opportunity-seeking being, lash out during high time. A small opportunity tend to spawn dozens of humans from nowhere. We crawl out from the hell’s kitchen of our own mind to snatch something that might be ours if we really tried hard. Yet, before these dark times, we incubate our mind for lesser known reasons. Procrastination and precrastination sway our mind lest we be helding our seemingly-unartistic thoughts.
There’s fear of beings with higher skills and intelligent. So, we try to slither quickly to rule over the things we want/wanted; like cockroaches trying to snatch the food before the humans pulverize them.
We try to come clean
It’s funny how we humans think cockroaches as the creature of dirt and roughness. We despise them, yet we are hidden from the fact that cockroaches are pretty clean insects. As enotmologist say, cockroaches constantly clean (groom) themselves. They run their legs and antennae over their bodies, then clean those appendages with their mouthparts. Ever see a cat groom? Cockroaches make cats look like slobs. It might be they despise us in fact.
So, we try to come clean as well. We act as if we are the only thing that can do something for own greater good. We try to act cool, fake a smile, fake our social activities and above all fake the social-online status just to be treated like a mighty little creature.
And that’s the reason we try to show ourselves clean. Clean in a sense of own twisted reputations that illusions the real “self”.
We are creepy
Cockroaches give you creeps. But we humans are no different. We slither over the land of hidden likeness, infatuation, love and lust. These are similar words with different sentiments. In our life we struggle hard to find someone we can have connection mentally. But that’s a long journey — a very long and timeless road. Before finding someone we feel connected to, the other phases try to creep into the mind; seep through our lustful nature.
I don’t know what cockroaches are thinking
But I do know humans are more savage, and lesser being than cockroaches.
The nuisance to the nature.
The resentment among each other.
The creatures that try to live in a reality powered by chaos illusions….

All I can do is watch and sit
Dunno where I’m going, what it’ll be
As if the wickedness inside
Has the audacity to defy it
Where souls wait to be bleached.
And all I can do is,
Just watch and sit.
Here I am, sitting and watching
As I peek into the time ticking.
All that is gone has never been
All that has gone is never seen
And the plot is on with this hum
And I know I will be gone…..
As the time is eating me
With veins full of misery
Life is crawling with mystery.
As I am just sitting and thinking
With hopes contemplating
I am seeing a streak.
A ray flashing at me
Behind these closed doors
Where I am locked up.
Here I am, with my blurred vision
A narrow path is emerging
Like an incision
Making it’s way through.
And clearer is the clue
I see it. A miracle. A ray.
I am begging it to stay
For the darkness seemed eternity
Where my time had lost its sanity
But now. I see it. A hope. A ray.
The ray is crawling on my mind
For it’s the only one of its kind
I remember now. The ray.
It’s the ray that sparks a fire
With hope emerging on a thin wire
Yes! Now I remember!
The narrow streak that never ends.
Yes! Now I remember. The ray.
It used to be my friend.
A hope in my mind
We used to blend
For I gave it a name. Niva
Niva. Oh Niva
Finally, you are here
Niva. Oh Niva
Here you are, returning from the stars
Inside a locked doors
Trying to make meaning of these void scars.


life is just like this very stage where we keep on moving back/forth. And most of the time, we feel much comfortable around the middle part. Or just staying at one point.
Learning is a continuous process. It happens throughout our life. Right from the birth till our inevitable fate, death.


Why’s it always in the core?
For the freedom of a bore
That tore the system apart
Making everyone the slaves.
It had to be with the sodomized rules
That governed the entire pulse
Unwillingly seeding into the breath
Why is it just in the core?
Why? everyone wonders
The vicinity of the enslaved
Why, why in the core?
They f**ked with ur mind
They hung your neck
They took your breath
Now, they are resurrecting your death
WHY?
They made the system, Framed the majority
Now they are puppeting…
They are who they are
In this age of dark terror
Why’s it always in the core?
They led the truth of lies into the dead
The resurrection has been fed
So, now what?
The silence of the answer remains..
Why???
They f**ked with the your mind
They hanged your neck
They took your breath
Now, they are resurrecting your death
Why??
Now, just go on and live the death of life
Be ressurrected and be cursed
So, make every moments of your life count and always keep on learning from what time throws at you.


Life is an abstraction
As I have been saying life is too much of a **complex** entity. Life is **abstract**.
In programming, the word abstraction implies:
hiding the complex operations by the use of simpler interfaces that anyone can access without having to know about the underlying complexity.
Abstract in a sense, you do not expose every bits of you to the outer world. The world only knows what you intend to present yourself:
an introvert, jerk, nerd, humourous, serious shit, knows-it-all or a knows-nothing, musician, worrier or warrier, serializer or parallelizer, dreamer or drummer, crier or carer.
Be it anything what you show. You are what you are truely inside.
An introvert might be known for shyness. But does the world really know the level of mischief s/he’s been doing to the close ones?
A musician might be **popular-kid-in-town**. But, does the world really know the level of plagiarism s/he’s been involved in ?
A dreamer: Does the world really know what illusions s/he has been creating or perhaps living in?
The face that you show to the outer world doesn’t quite represent the exact stuffs that happen inside your mind truely.
You are really what you hide inside that mask.
And the mask is really the remnant of what you are trying to cover up.
This is the exact case that has been happening to the juniors/seniors studying engineering. ( I am referencing engineering, especially “Programming shit”, because unfortunately I am a pending engineer headed into extincion, perhaps).
From the very beginning (start of the first year) to the end of the final year, we are always mounting that very mask that has been creating the illusion of “all is well! all is well”. People tend to be more ignorant than they actually think they are. Especially on the habits, behaviours and such.
Ok! Here’s the catch.
In the beginning, you know nothing.
This has a positive effect on the mindset for learning surreal stuffs. New energy, new enthusiasm and never-ending target of new things. You get involved into friends; the friends don’t give a shit. You get invovled into social vicinity; you become fuzzy yet strong. The fuzzier you are, the more you are creating the mask.
As days pass by, you evolve with greater good; be it the technical, philosophical, psychological, biological or any evil mindset. Eventually, you live in a bounded sphere where you are revolving with daily procrastination. And that instant gratification monkey changes the trajectory of your learning curve. Finally, you don’t even bother for such “learning” stuff and go on becoming chill. This is the very truth for all the young minds on which the world itself is being mounted for better future.
Hence, the real mask gets stuck on your face real hard this time. You forget what you had intended to do, what you wanted to achieve and what you wanted to influence. And you expose something that doesn’t really show who you really are. The abstraction is real, so is that mask.
So! What’s the catch actually?
Never let yourself go fuzzy
Find your true passion and interest and channel your optimal (yet leisure) time to solely build upon that passion. That’s the only way you can improve over certain things. It doesn’t have to be “one giant leap for mankind”. Even a 5-minutes “Today I learned” can make a difference, especially when you are into programming and such.
Time allocation is hard I know
We all have that phase in life where we have nothing to do; yet we don’t have free time. And that’s the actual catch here.
Procrastination is a real sucker and beating it in its own game is paranoid.
So, how can we really improve so that we can unmask ourself bit by bit?
Start small. Bigger events unfold through small tidbits. For example, looking up a subreddit once in a while (doesnt have to be too long) or reading some answers in quora might be a good kickstarter.
And if you feel lazy in doing that, relax.

We are all no-brainers. You have someone in your chat list who can really inspire you to learn stuffs. (Dog knows what, s/he really cares about you, perhaps.) Asking about the things you find difficult to grasp can really clear your confusion on the topics.
You expose your true self by asking questions.
If that’s a drag, just don’t fret about it.
Take a nap.
Reboot your mind for a fresh start for the formal actions mentioned.
And, don’t forget to attain seminars and meetups for self-improvement. Interaction with people might boost your confidence at some level. Yes, I know being an introvert is a let down. But, hey! At least we can give it a try.
Still we learn nothing

Yes, the chart about a semester. It is so meta. This is the very reason procrastination is a game changer in each semester you(will/have) attain(ed). Not because it helps but it deforms the very force that’s gluing your mind and the ability to learn.
The real culprit
By now, you might have been totally infiltrated by the total chaosness of this article itself. And trust me, you’ve even scrolled some of other sites parallely like looking for notifications in your facebook / twitter. That’s natural. Embrace it. This is the real culprit.
Lower Attention Span and Multi-tasking
Our ability to multitask is a marvelous feature in evolution itself. And we take it for granted. Why shouldn’t we afterall. We (just) love multitasking. Damn, multitasking itself is so full of being in transcendental state.
Here’s one “good” article on the perils of multitasking.
But then. Everything comes with consequences
…and you should be able to embrace them gracefully. You whine about not completing a specific task and keep on doing some random actions that you find them joyous momentarily.
Afterall, you belong to two kinds of people:
Serializer vs Parallelizer
“Serializers”, as I categorize, are those people who tend to complete one task at a time. Such people tend to be more cautious about the deadlines and dedication. In fact, one of the better techniques for being a serializer is:
Focus. Focus. Focus. And break.
Yes, this is a Pomodoro Technique.
Know it. Implement it. Serialize it.
In the end, it is fruitful and you tend to learn deeply by learning one task at a time.
“Parallelizers”, as I categorize, are just opposite to serializers. Multitaskers, people with lower attention span, or anything you can call.
It’s like distributing your bodily energy on various tasks. Hence, lesser workdone and such.
But
It’s all about your interests and passion. Just channel your interests on a relatively “right” track.
Learn to embrace rejection. Learn to learn. and never let the flame of being a noob die.
Afterall,
we are to become what we intend to with deep passion.


People circling me
A void in the middle
People serenading
I am startled
People flying “in”
A hope uncovered
People masquerading
I am lost
People looking for me
A hope displaced
People crying
I am embraced
People spacing out
A make believe
People empathizing
For I am the pit


Here they are
Creeping upon the vengeance
With a cold desire
What about a consequence?
Once again there they are
Seeking my death
Searching, provoking
That's all they are
In the sight,Not too far
They searched through hell
At least that is all
I can tell...My friend!!!
That is all I can tell
They slaughtered, they murdered
They searched, they sought
Thye spoke of no reason
And i ended in no-heaven
And that was the end, I thought
For once again they searched
This time, they had a reason
A reason bestowed upon me,
For I was the only one left behind
Kept in the smoke, darker than black
Not Like a needle in the haystack
For I could do nothing
For I could do nothing
This time, i ran
Nowhere indefinitely;Not dead, not alive
Deep beneath upon the hell
My existence could divide
They searched, they sought
With a slaughter vision
Wanting for a massacre
If and only if 
Everybody was around
For I was the only one left behind
For I could be something
For I could be nothing
Finally, they hunted me down
For I was the only one up
They slaughtered, they murdered
For I was the only THOUGHT...
The one to be left behind...
For I was the only THOUGHT...


Knowledge and Wisdom, as I see.
“Knowledge is power”, as they say.
As the human civilization soar high through the unknown passage of time, knowledge has been the essence in every life. Knowledge is the information and we human thrive for information; not to smooth-out our whole life, but to find pleasure and happiness.
Human beings rise on the giant shoulder of the knowledge that has been passed down from generations, so that the future won’t live like dead. The very books, scrolls, papers, that has powered the information pool of today is the key that our source of knowledge is enriched and well lived.
Gathering knowledge is good enough to make one’s life. However being “wise” is more than simply having knowledge. It is one thing to memorize the books and facts. However it is the wise thing to use those knowledge to drive the forces for betterment. Boxing up concept is good enough , but ability to think outside the box is greater.
(as In the passage by Bertrand Russell) The very example of nuclear outbreak is enough to make us realize the boundaries where knowledge and wisdom get separated as two entities. The creation of nuclear energy is from knowledge. However had mankind been wise enough, the atomic bombing would not be alive in the history books we read today.
The very core of every civilization may be the knowledge that powers it. However, it is the wisest words earned through experience of life and death that could have made humans a boon to nature.
You may know how to propose a girl (that’s knowledge). However it is the wisdom to find “true love and happiness”. He who refines the knowledge can seek the wisdom that was not sought. A person that has learnt the way of life and time may have wisdom because he/she has stood up from the mistakes that had been committed in the life.
“Knowledge is power, wisdom is light”, as I say.
We humans have developed and advanced so much through the knowledge that has been passed down from generation to generation, we are more informative and knowledgeable today than the people were in the past. The sole reason is “tons” of information that we have today. Be it from Sir Isaac Newton, Leonardo Da Vinci, Aristotle to Sigmund Freud to that professor who teaches in your class.
I don’t mean to wipe out their legacy, here
Well, they are all knowledgeable, informative and can make you understand the concept of so-called world. You may have better information from the information-pool of tons of books and the internet of lies, there are few in million who are wise enough.
People in the past were much WISER than that of today. And it is not the matter of simplicity that defines the wisdom, it is much complex that ought to be. Life, death, self-awareness, experience, feelings, sense of priority, comprehensiveness, are all that summed up to refine a centered-knowledge into the wiser information for wisdom. We may have progressed in science, technology, health,etc through the infinite knowledge-pool we have today but we do not know much about how to teach wisdom. In the course of time, the wiser words had been abandoned in favour of personal or community improvements. Those awesome people of the past who learnt the hard way through struggle , experiences were wise enough to give you “revival” potion for your life, for humanity and mankind.
Just as a growing child senses the world through a mere physical form, gradually gains the hold of the world outside, it is the wisdom that teaches that child to act in the puppeted-world to have a self-esteem and to love others; world-centered knowledge he/she gains and gradually gains wisdom.
that is wisdom, an evolved knowledge; gained selfishly or selflessly
